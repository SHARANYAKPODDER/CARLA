# CARLA
CARLA is an open-source simulator for autonomous driving researce in urban driving.
I have made 6 different .py scripts while experimenting with CARLA environment.
In carlacode1, I have just changed the map,
In carlacode2, I introduced any vehicle as the user wants and with the map the user wants.
In carlacode3, Spawning the sensor and attaching it to the vehicle.
In carlacode4, Spawning the vehicle at a particular location and controlling it.
In carlacode5, Defined some global variables for the sensor.
In carlacode6, I have modified the camera manager part in the existing code.
